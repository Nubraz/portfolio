## About  
This course has many components to navigate.  In order to track all of the assignments, you may use the [Labor Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZaRThi7Hs6ZSQXpBaWGveCt74S6xzvjr7XO5tG3Gvgw/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Docs.  [Instructions for how to use it are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YQXvS03YlkrWim4W4XSsF5lHo623tL7iVkN4eMGieUc/edit?usp=sharing).  You are responsible for recording your Community Labor, which you will do in the attached rMarkdown.

## Learning Objectives (idk if it's relevant here?)  

## Instructions  
Your community labor will be kept track of through the Community Labor Log.  To record a piece of labor, find its place in the list of labor and update its Date to reflect when you completed it.  For example, to record your first Peer Review Workshop, find the line `add_row(Labor = "Peer Review Workshop 1", Date = NA)`, and change `Date = NA` to `Date = "2/7"`.  If you're recording Slack Engagement, you **must** add a link to your post.  To add a link, hover over your message on Slack, click “More Actions”, then click on “Copy link.  Then, find the `add_row` for the engagement, and update `[Slack Engagement 1]()` to say `[Slack Engagement 1](Your Link Here)`.  Knit the document to see your Community Labor Log complete.
