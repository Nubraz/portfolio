# Discourse Analysis

For this assignment, you have two options: you can 1) watch 1 video (at least 45 minutes long) of a talk about data delivered by a data scientist, or 2) three TED talks (at least 15 minutes each) about data. Please confirm your selection with me ahead of time by DM'ing me on Slack.

## Analyzing the talks

Following the framework here, you should examine how data is talked about in the video(s). Consider the epistemologies vocalized, the binary oppositions that structure the language, the rhetorical strategies used, and what this tells us about data culture. You should transcribe a series of quotes from the talks that capture something important you plan to interpret in your write-up.

## Write-up

Following your analysis, you will write-up a 750-1000 word memo detailing the discourse conveyed in the talk(s). If you choose option 2, you should offer some comparison and/or synthesis of the discourse across the talks.  

## Criteria for completion

* Student writes a 750-1000 word memo detailing the discourse of the talk. Direct quotations should be referenced throughout (and cited), but do not count towards the overall word count.
